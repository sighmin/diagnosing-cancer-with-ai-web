# Web interface for [intelligence](https://github.com/sighmin/diagnosing-cancer-with-ai)

[Intelligence](https://github.com/sighmin/diagnosing-cancer-with-ai) is a ruby gem
I wrote to demonstrate various computational intelligence paradiagms. It's intended to
appeal to rubyists (that's why it's written in ruby) and serve as an example of
how metaphors are used in AI, and how they're not mystical in anyway.

Ordinarily I would suggest something like `scipy` if you would like to get into
using AI in production code, but this is simply a demonstration.

## Installation

* Install ruby version in `.ruby-version`
* Install rubygems if yo don't got it

* Bundle `bundle install`
